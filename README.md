## Course Information

Course Code: EEE227

Programme: HND Electrical Engineering (Level 200)

This project is a console-based digital attendance system developed using C++.

It is designed to replace the traditional paper-based attendance system used in lecture halls.

The system allows lecturers to register students, create lecture sessions, mark attendance,
